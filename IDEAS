Adaptive initial octree refinement for many solids (e.g. with flat faces only); Use points sampled from solids
and insert them initially into the octree; This will create the initial structure; Something like

octree_insert_points (octree, points, pointspercell)

will do (and will also be useful for fluid).

The tree cells should be marker either us search cells or as insert cells; The current insert_shape routine
should start working down from insert cells; The unique shape leaves routine shoud distinguish between outside
and inside a cell (now this is combined); Then we should stop recursion or proceed down the tree accordingly;

Consistent Particle Method by Koh et al. for fluids

Material Point Method for solids?

Fine solid method discretized eigenmodes later matched with small subset of Chebyshev polynomials
