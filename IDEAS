Issues:
#######

Union of two cubes along flat faces => internal surfaces are left in triangulation (perturbation criterion fails here).
Also two layers of overlapping internal triangles are created since discrimination of repeated surfaces does not work (sign difference).

Needed:
#######

remove: shape_copy ()
change: shape_combine () so that it packs the output shape into a single block of memory
