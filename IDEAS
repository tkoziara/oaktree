Issues:
#######

Polygonisation of isosurfaces ideally aligned with octree planes. Currently ideal 0-levels are filtered out in polygonise.
Doubly layered triangles could be cerated in this case. In rare cases the current code may not polygonise such cuts.

Needed:
#######

remove: shape_copy ()
change: shape_combine () so that it packs the output shape into a single block of memory
